## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
The aim of our project is to deliver a light-weight, low-cost but highly efficient background screening web services for small and medium companies to facilitate fast, frictionless and digital-centric onboarding experiences for their users. To better achieve this objective, we also employed machine reasoning methods like rule based reasoning and certainty factors to accelerate screening processes and to improve risk evaluation accuracy.


Our team: ai.Orz: comprising of 6 members: Dai Yirui, Dong Meirong, Gu Lijian, Guo Feng, Wong Yoke Keong, Zhang Le are from different areas including financial, cloud, programming etc.. We hope to deliver a widely used platform which can bring core-value for enterprises, helping corporates to do digital transformation, raising efficiencies, lowering cost, interacting platform with enterprises' existing systems. We found digitised background screening is important in driving the success of a business, building a comprehensive IT system to accurately verify clients’ background and predict risk scores can be costly. So we decide to introduce Merchant Onboarding project.
